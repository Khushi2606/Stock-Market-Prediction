Stock-Market-Prediction
Stock market prediction using machine learning involves analyzing historical data, market trends, and indicators to forecast future stock prices. Key steps include:

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Gather and clean historical price, market, and economic data.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Create indicators like moving averages and sentiment analysis for better predictions.
3. **Model Training:** Use algorithms like regression, decision trees, or neural networks to train on historical data.
4. **Evaluation:** Test model performance using metrics like accuracy or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
5. **Deployment:** Deploy the model for real-time predictions and continuously update it based on new data.

The goal is to identify patterns that can signal future stock movements.
